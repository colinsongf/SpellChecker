mrs. tim williams was about 21 , with skin the color of bitter chocolate , and if you discounted the << plain >> dress and worn slippers , she was startlingly pretty . 
one family bound wounds with bacon or salt pork strips , or , if these were not handy , << plain >> lard . 
but without waiting for them to try it , she scattered the dogs and shot down the reef and out across the << plain >> . 
score << plain >> side of c and leave in mold . 
it is << plain >> as hell johnson is no reactionary . 
the girls sit quietly with the musicians , wearing prim dresses or << plain >> , secretarial shifts , until it is time to go off to a back room and reappear in the spare uniform of the harem . 
sometimes the bubbling sound of geysers came faintly across the << plain >> to the herd of men ; ; 
you had grown up at a time when the most distinguishing mark of a lady was the noli me tangere writ << plain >> across her face . 
with rex stout's nero wolfe , alienation is represented on a purely physical << plane >> . 
with increasing advance of the knife into the coating the shear << plane >> extends to the coatings surface and the shear angle rapidly decreases . 
he is thought either to have been killed by the fascists as soon as he landed or to have killed himself by flying out to sea and crashing his << plane >> . 
`` he says he'll be here on the one-o'clock << plane >> . 
from the time the chocks were pulled until the << plane >> was out of sight , he knew donovan would keep his back to the strip . 
as a matter of fact , fogg and his << plane >> didn't get beyond pennsylvania in the race -- an engine oil leak forced him down -- but the flying service and school he started subsequently were first steps in paying off his wry-faced backers . 
if a is the major axis of an ellipsoid and b and c are the other two axes , the radius of curvature in the ab << plane >> at the end of the axis af , and the difference in pressure along the a and b axes is af . 
so captain jenks returned to his harbor post to watch the scouting << plane >> put in five more appearances , and to feel the certainty of this dread rising within him . 
for if it did , the << plane >> of l and l' would contain two generators of af , which is impossible . 
the tensioning members have a common drive so that the application of restorative force takes place simultaneously in all directions in the << plane >> of the test specimen . 
an electrostatic system suffers generally from image << plane >> curvature leading to defocusing in the peripheral image region if a flat viewing screen ( or interstage coupler ) is utilized , while a magnetic system requires accurate adjustment of the solenoid , which is heavy and bulky . 
the << plane >> rumbled and slowed . 
the molecular forces holding the coating to the substrate are obviously greater than the cohesive strength of the coating and failure occurs by shear along a << plane >> starting at the tip of the knife and extending to the coating surface . 
under equilibrium cutting conditions , the chip exerts a force af against the coating and an equal opposite force af against the knife in the << plane >> of the substrate as shown in fig. 6 . 
if the rake angle **yc of the knife is high enough and the friction angle **yt between the front of the knife and the back of the chip is low enough to give a positive value for af , the resultant vector r will lie above the << plane >> of the substrate . 
the promenade , for example , continues to take place on the chahar bagh , a mile-long garden of << plane >> and poplar trees that now serves as the city's principal street . 
by 800 social and cultural security had been achieved , at least on a simple << plane >> ; ; 
the first few days bob fogg set his << plane >> down on towne field back of the state house when the wind was right , and used wilson flat above barre when it wasn't .
