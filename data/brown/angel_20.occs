she soared over the new pastor like an avenging << angel >> lest he stray from the path and not know all the truth and gossip of which she was chief repository . 
a new radial drill press with a 16 inch capacity has a tilting head that allows drilling to be done at any << angle >> . 
the measurements made with the nrl 50-foot reflector , which is altitude-azimuth-mounted , would have shown a systematic change with local hour << angle >> in the measured intensities of venus and jupiter if a substantial part of the radiation had been linearly polarized . 
that was the new advertising << angle >> -- something about a lloyd's of london policy to insure the secrecy of the secret ingredient . 
every morning early , in the summer , we searched the trunks of the trees as high as we could reach for the locust shells , carefully detached their hooked claws from the bark where they hung , and stabled them , a weird faery herd , in an << angle >> between the high roots of the tulip tree , where no grass grew in the dense shade . 
merchant has found that the same basic relationships which describe the geometry and force systems in the case of the cutting mechanism can also be applied to the discontinuous chip formation provided the proper values of instantaneous shear << angle >> and instantaneous chip thickness or cross-sectional area are used . 
and **yb is the << angle >> the resultants make with the plane of the substrate . 
because the rake << angle >> af at the tip of the knife is very much smaller ( or even negative ) when compared to the value of **yc for the major portion of the knife , a very rapid increase in cutting force with thickness will result . 
the platform is initially off level by the << angle >> aj . 
in actual practice , the values most readily amenable to measurement are the cutting force af and the shear << angle >> aj .
