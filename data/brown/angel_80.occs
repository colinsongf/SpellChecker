cloud made an interesting statement in parting from his client : `` i wanted to be a lawyer , and mrs. wright wanted me to be an avenging << angel >> . 
a small , rock-carved << angel >> watched her from a nearby tomb , the only << angel >> in the cemetery . 
the sooner you act like an << angel >> the quicker you'll feel angelic . 
in the second and third chapters of revelation the new version retains , however , the old phrase `` << angel >> of the church '' which biblical scholars have previously interpreted as meaning bishop . 
`` if you substitute ' atom ' for ' << angel >> ' , the problem is not insoluble , given the metallic content of the pin in question '' . 
foster listened with angelic patience until digby ran down , then said , `` listen , junior , you're an << angel >> now -- so forget it . 
but she was afraid the first lady would not understand , because rob roy was a perfect << angel >> with the first family . 
occasionally , for no reason that i could see , they would suddenly alter the << angle >> of their trot . 
consequently , if the shear << angle >> **yf is replaced by the rupture << angle >> af , the relationships as described in eqns. ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) , ( 4 ) , and ( 6 ) will directly apply . 
**yt is the friction << angle >> ; ; 
at each << angle >> of its pitch a big skylight had been fitted into the roof and all these skylights were fitted with systems of multiple screens and shades . 
consequently , both the rake << angle >> of the knife as well as the friction occurring between the back of the removed coating and the front of the knife will determine in large part the detailed mechanism of the cutting removal process . 
if it is assumed that the formula given by lodge of cosec af applies , the pressure difference along the major axes can be calculated from the << angle >> of inclination of the major axis , and from this the interfacial tension can be calculated . 
according to philippoff , the recoverable shear s is given by af where **yc is the << angle >> of extinction . 
this signifies that **yc , the rake << angle >> , is no longer a constant to zero film thickness . 
with integration , the effect of a small acceleration ( or small platform tilt << angle >> ) can be seen after a time . 
if the rake << angle >> **yc of the knife is high enough and the friction << angle >> **yt between the front of the knife and the back of the chip is low enough to give a positive value for af , the resultant vector r will lie above the plane of the substrate . 
let exactly 1'' '' of `` a '' extend beyond `` b '' and use a square to check your << angle >> to exactly 90 degrees . 
a sufficiently good approximation for determining the end reflection losses r can be obtained from the << angle >> independent fresnel formula : af . 
the result of the observations is af where the phase << angle >> , q , is measured in degrees from new moon and the probable errors include absolute as well as relative errors . 
these two values and the rake << angle >> **yc are sufficient to determine the other parameters of these relationships . 
the received radiation is compared with the radiation from a hypothetical black body which subtends the same solid << angle >> as the visible disk of the planet . 
he , too , cocked his cap at a jaunty << angle >> , jingled marbles in his pocket , and swaggered down main street . 
cut beveled edge on the long sides of clay at a 45-degree << angle >> to miter corners . 
if the polarity is correct , the platform will turn until the heading error << angle >> is zero . 
the << angle >> af is measured in the medium of index af . 
mold was used as pattern and clay cut by holding knife at about 45-degree << angle >> , to form an undercut , making base smaller than the pattern top . 
the << angle >> generated by the platform servo **yf multiplied by g is the effective acceleration acting on the accelerometer . 
if the << angle >> of fire were too great the jutting buildings on either side would interfere . 
if a wedge-shaped coating of increasing thickness is removed from a substrate by an instrument like the hesiometer with a knife of constant rake << angle >> , a number of removal mechanisms are often observed which depend upon the thickness of the coating . 
**yf is the << angle >> the shear plane makes with the substrate ; ; 
in the next , the shear plane << angle >> is high , and extends to the inclined work surface . 
the fact that even the larger letters weighed only 5 lb. each made it possible to secure the letters to the building through clear acrylic << angle >> brackets cemented to the letters . 
the half-intensity diameter of the antenna beam was about 9' , and the << angle >> subtended by the moon included the entire main beam and part of the first side lobes . 
the various forces result from the reaction of the removed paint chip against the face of the knife and along the shear plane , which makes an << angle >> **yf with the substrate . 
with increasing advance of the knife into the coating the shear plane extends to the coatings surface and the shear << angle >> rapidly decreases . 
the equation relating input acceleration to output platform << angle >> is af . 
this << angle >> of just where the orioles can look for improvement this year is an interesting one . 
the platform << angle >> **yf is the << angle >> about which the gyro is controlling . 
an analysis of the vector relationships shows that the rake << angle >> **yc and the friction << angle >> **yt determine the vector direction af of the force resultants r and af . 
**yc is the rake << angle >> of the knife ; ; 
he turned , then , to look toward the lighted boulevard , and saw rourke's tall , emaciated figure come out of the lounge and hurriedly start to << angle >> across the street toward the opposite side . 
babe ruth , as he always did in the stadium , played right field to avoid having the sun in his eyes , and tommy thevenow , a rather mediocre hitter who played shortstop for the st. louis cardinals , knocked a ball with all his might into the sharp << angle >> formed by the permanent stands and the wooden bleachers , where ruth could not reach it . 
the antenna patterns and the power gain at the peak of the beam were both measured ( mayer , mccullough , and sloanaker , 1958 ) , so that the absolute power sensitivity of the antenna beam over the solid << angle >> of the moon was known . 
`` they were supposed to meet thor at nine pm for a conference concerning the ad campaign for their soap , a new << angle >> based on this sx-21 stuff '' .
